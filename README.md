# Hang Man Game
This is a simple Python implementation of the classic word-guessing game. In Hangman, players try to guess a hidden word letter by letter. With each incorrect guess, a part of the hangman is drawn. The game ends when the player successfully guesses the word or runs out of guesses, resulting in the hangman being fully drawn.

Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game:
- Choose a word category by entering a number between 1 and 10.
- Enter a letter to guess the word.
- Continue guessing until you solve the word or make too many incorrect guesses.
- Choose whether to play again after finishing a game.
